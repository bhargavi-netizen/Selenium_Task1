## Description
As part of internship at CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS I was assigned a task in the domain of Software Testing. specially to automate the testing of a sample web application using Selenium WebDriver.The goal of this task was to create a script that cloud verify the login functionality and navigation of a web application and generate a detailed test showing the results of the execution 
This project was developed as part of my internship at **CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS** under the **Software Testing** domain.
The objective of this task was to automate the testing of a sample web application using **Selenium WebDriver**.

The automation script verifies the **login functionality**, **navigation**, and **logout process** of the web application.
After execution, the script generates a **detailed test execution report** that records the results of each test step.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of test automation, browser interaction, and result validation using Selenium with Python.


## Tools Used
* **Python**
* **Selenium WebDriver**
* **Mozilla Firefox**
* **GeckoDriver**

  
## Files
* **`login_navigation_test.py`**

  * Python script that automates login, navigation, and logout functionality.
* **`Test_Execution_Report.txt`**

  * Text file containing detailed test execution results and status.



## Test Scenarios Covered
URL: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login
username:tomsmith
password:SuperSecretPassword
Automation Steps Performed:
* Launching the web application
* Validating login with credentials
* Verifying successful navigation after login
* Performing logout operation
* Confirming redirection after logout



## Conclusion

This task helped in gaining hands-on experience with **Selenium WebDriver**, understanding automated test workflows, and generating execution reports.
It strengthened practical skills in **software testing automation** and **Python scripting**.
